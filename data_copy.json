In each move, it goes down 3 steps and up by 2 steps. How many moves it has to make to reach the water.","A":7,"B":14,"C":5,"D":4,"ans":"B","detail":"(Moving down is negative & moving up is positive) For each move, the monkey makes 3 steps down & 2 steps up, which is equal to -3+2 = -1 => one step down. So it has to take 14 moves from step 1 to reach the water in the 15th step."},
