# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

I am Dasa, a mechanical engineer by profession.

It is my habit to search for information needed for clarity when conversing with friends. During a conversation like that, I started recording my searches under the guidance of a friend.


I have created this website for these posts. This website is built on VueJs, VuePress and explores information with the help of R programming.

This website is a compilation of my pursuits in elections, education, economics, and other topics. Some titles have been contributed by others. 

Please post your comments.

Your feedback and comments are highly appreciated.

Your comments will give me the inspiration to continue with this journey.
