This is an educational platform that deals mostly with the Indian political system and the past elections of India. Also, this website contains information about economics, education and others. The information provided on this website is purely based on our understanding and data collected from various sources.

The Data Talks website provides descriptive statistical information on the above-mentioned subjects. <!-- And we are trying to touch inferential statistics of some areas. -->

Our motto is to present the data to the public in an easily readable format with collective information in a single place.

The data available on our website is solely based on various open sources available on the internet, results published by the election
commission of India on the internet, newspapers & news channels.

We did our best to meet the accuracy of data and we are continuously working to improve.
