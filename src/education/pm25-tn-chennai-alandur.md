Tamil Nadu has 5 stations for continuous monitoring of air pollution.
Out of which 4 stations are in Chennai and one station in Coimbatore. This document talks about PM2.5 (Particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of fewer than 2.5 micrometers) level for one of the station
named Alandur Bus Depot, Chennai.

## Conclusions from the below analysis:

The PM2.5 data has 5.3% outliers and the details of outliers are given
in the below analysis. After removing the outliers the PM2.5 level for
Alandur falls under the category of "moderate" in summer season &
monsoon1 season. It is slightly higher than "unhealthy for sensitive
groups" in other seasons.

There is not much difference in PM2.5 level for weekend & weekday.

## Data

Data Source: <https://app.cpcbccr.com/>\
Date downloaded: 07-Jan-2020\
Hourly data taken for this analysis 01-Oct-2017 to 30-Nov-2019\
Total 18962 records & 4468 records are having "none" reading for PM2.5.
All "none" records removed for this analysis. The complete analysis was
done using R programming.

Below are the categories defined in 2012 EPA (United States
Environmental Protection Agency) PM2.5 standard

Good - 0.0 -- 12.0 µg/m3, 24-hour average\
Moderate - 12.1 -- 35.4 µg/m3, 24-hour average\
Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups - 35.5 -- 55.4 µg/m3, 24-hour average\
Unhealthy - 55.5 -- 150.4 µg/m3, 24-hour average\
Very Unhealthy - 150.5 -- 250.4 µg/m3, 24-hour average\
Hazardous - 250.5 -- 350.4 µg/m3, 24-hour average\
Hazardous - 350.5 -- 500 µg/m3, 24-hour average

## Details of Outliers:

An outlier is any datapoint that lies outside the 1.5 \* inter quartile
range (IQR). IQR is calculated as the distance between the 25th
percentile and 75th percentile values for that variable. We have
identified the outliers using R-command "BoxPlot".

Below are the details of minimum, maximum, mean & median of identified
outliers.

<div class="lowfont">

| Min.  | 1st Qu. | Median | Mean  | 3rd Qu. | Max.   |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| 116.0 | 130.1   | 154.2  | 272.1 | 252.8   | 1000.0 |

</div>

The below box plot & bar chart shows the difference in data with & without outliers.

Outliers identified: 731\
Proportion of outliers: 5.3%\
Mean of the outliers: 272.11\
Mean without removing outliers: 51.32\
Mean after we remove outliers: 39.59

## Yearly Mean/Average of Hourly PM2.5 for different Seasons:

All the below results were calculated after removing outliers from the
source data. The first table shows the monthly average of PM2.5 & the
second table shows the 24 hours average for each month.

## Season classification:

-   Jan & Feb - Winter
-   Mar, Apr & May - Summer
-   Jun, Jul, Aug & Sep - Monsoon1
-   Oct, Nov, Dec - Monsoon2

The below plot gird shows the year-wise details of hourly PM2.5 levels
for different seasons.The blue line across each plot indicates Smoothed
conditional means.

From the below data, it is very clear that the pollution levels are less
in summer compared to other seasons.

## Mean/Average of Hourly PM2.5 for Weekdays & Weekends

The below plot grid shows the hourly PM2.5 levels for weekdays and
weekends. The blue line across each plot indicates Smoothed conditional
means.

The below plot shows that, there is not much difference in PM2.5 levels
for weekdays & weekends.
