## Legislative Constituency (LC):

In 1953, the Madras state was renamed as "Tamil Nadu" and some parts of
Madras state were separated. The details are:

1.  Coastal Andhra & Rayalaseema to form the state of
    Andhra Pradesh
2.  South Canara & Bellary district to form Mysore state
3.  Malabar district to form Kerala

The state of Madras had 309 assembly constituencies during the 1951
election. Out of which 243 were single-member constituencies & 66 were
dual-member constituencies. In the 1957 election, the state of TamilNadu
had 167 assembly constituencies in which 129 were single member
constituencies and 38 dual member constituencies. **Dual member
constituency** -- A single constituency will be represented by two
representatives and currently this system is practiced nowhere in the
world. India had dual member constituency until 1961 and abolition of
dual member constituency act was introduced in 1961. From 1967 the state
has 234 assembly constituencies until 2019.
