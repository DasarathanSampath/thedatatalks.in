## Ruling Parties:

Unlike other Indian states/union territories, Delhi was not having the
same status from 1951. In 1951 Delhi was a Part-C state and **"Chaudhary
Brahm Prakash"** became the first chief minister of Delhi. In 1956, it
was made as a Union territory under the direct control of President of
India. In 1966 the assembly was replaced by "Delhi Metropolitan Council"
which is completely controlled by the Governor of Delhi and the council
had no legislative powers. In 1991 the council was replaced by Delhi
legislative assembly and the "union territory of Delhi" was formally
called as National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT of Delhi). NCT of
Delhi is a union territory and it has its own legislature like
Puducherry.

India (had no election in this period)\
1966 to 1990 -- Delhi Metropolitan council under the direct control of
Governor of Delhi (had three elections in 1972, 1977 & 1983)\
From 1991 -- Formally known as NCT of Delhi which is a union territory
and has its own legislatures (had 6 elections in 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008,
