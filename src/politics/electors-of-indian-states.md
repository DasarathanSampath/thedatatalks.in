The objective of this analysis is to 

-	Measure the increase or decrease in electors count for various states
-	Measure the change in voters count or polling percentage
-	Comparing electors growth between various states of India

Census of India systematically collects information about the population of India every 10 years. The last census report was published in the year 2011 and the next census is planned for the year 2021. The census data gives information about the prospective growth of the population of a country. 


One of the primary duties of the Indian election commission of India is to verify the electors' list, add new electors, remove electors in case of death and remove duplicates. The voting age of elections in India is 18 years and the electoral list consists of a population whose age is above 18 years. 

The data source for this analysis is
<https://eci.gov.in/>

If the electoral data is considered as data of a population whose age is above 18 years, then this analysis gives an indirect measure for the increase/decline/stagnated population in various states of India.
Also, this analysis resulted in an understanding of

-	Year of formation of various states after Independence
-	Re-organization of various regions based on the linguistic identification of different languages in India
-	Indirect measure for the growth of different language speaking population

## Keywords

Electors – Eligible to vote
