If you look at the bar chart **(Electors/Voters)**, the average increase
in electors is calculated to **9.85% E-YoY (approximately),** which is
approximately **3.5%** lesser growth when compared to **India's average
elector's growth of 13%**. The average polling percentage of Tamil Nadu
falls at **67%**, which is approximately **7%** higher when compared to
**India's average polling percentage of 60%**.

The above mentioned average values are calculated without considering
1951 data since there was a major change in constituencies in 1953.

The total voters in the bar chart for the year 1951 & 1957 were
back-calculated from reported polling percentage since Tamil Nadu had
dual member & single-member constituencies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Male & Female voters:

1951 & 1957 male/female voting values are not available; hence we have
taken data from the year 1962.

The line chart clearly shows that the male & female voting percentage is
traveling parallel to each other.

Female voters in 2011 & 2016 were slightly more than male voters and it
shows **women in Tamil Nadu have started showing more social
responsibility**.

The average percentage of male voters is calculated to **71.31%**, which
is **11.31%** higher when compared to **India's average polling
percentage of 60%**.

The average percentage of female voters is calculated to **67.48%**,
which is **7.48%** higher when compared to **India's average polling
percentage of 60%**.
